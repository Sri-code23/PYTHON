# Lambda function explanation
# A lambda function is a small anonymous function in Python.
# It can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

# Example of a lambda function
# This lambda function takes one argument 'x' and returns its square
sum = lambda x, y: x + y
print(sum(3, 4))
